/**
 * STUDY this until the concept is clear to you, it is very important!
 *
 * A function is simply some instructions (code) that we want to save so that
 * we can re-use it without having to re-write the steps again and again.
 *
 * Parameters are just like variables, they can be named anything and can store
 * any kind of data. The difference is that parameters are variables that
 * hold value / data that is passed into a function at the time of the
 * function being called / executed / invoked.
 *
 * The parameters of a function are whatever outside information the function
 * needs in order to do it's job. Just like if I asked you to add together
 * two numbers, you would ask me, which two numbers? Our function needs
 * to know the same thing to add two numbers together. Get in the habit
 * of asking yourself what a function needs in order to do it's job to
 * determine what parameters are needed. Just as you would request needed
 * information to complete a task you were given, a function would need that
 * information to do the same task, because you are the one writing the
 * function to make it work. Remember this!
